#### Task 1

 - Task 1 was completed by modifying the serial output of the code to include a sample number in order for the data to be easily sorted. Then, as directed, 50 samples of each gesture were captured. The serial output data was captured through [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) and compiled into a csv file.

#### Task 2

 - Task 2 was completed in almost the exact same manner as Task 1. An extra column was added to the data so that the samples were numbered, and then the data was collected as directed. Once again, the serial output data was captured through [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) and compiled into a csv file.

#### Task 3

 - Task 3 was completed using the built-in example code that was modified so that the sensor was started in grayscale. From there, a dataset was created in OpenMV, and then the pictures were captured through OpenMV and stored locally on the computer.
